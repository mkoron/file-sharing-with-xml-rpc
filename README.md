# Project 8: File Sharing with XML-RPC

In this project we will create a simple file sharing, *peer-to-peer*, application based on 
the XML-RPC technology.

Start a couple of peers and put their urls in urls.txt file. Create a folder meant 
for sharing.

Once you have started the client, use the following command for getting a file:

	> fetch filename
